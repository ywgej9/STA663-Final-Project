# STA663-Final-Project
This is a readme file for STA663 Final Project.

Our project focuses on implementing stochastic-gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo from Chen, Fox and Guestrin (2014) paper, Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  

This repo contains the source code, a test code, a real-world example and a jupyter notebook.
